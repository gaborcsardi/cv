\usage{
cvSelect(
  procedure,
  data,
  k = nrow(data),
  seed,
  parallel = FALSE,
  ncores = parallelly::availableCores(logical = FALSE),

}
\arguments{
\item{procedure}{a model-selection procedure function that accepts the following arguments:
`data`, set to the data argument to `cvSelect()`;
`indices`, the indices of the rows of data defining the current fold; if missing,
the model-selection procedure is applied to the full data; other arguments, to be
passed via `...`. `procedure()` should return a two-element vector with the result
of applying a cross-validation criterion to the cases in
the current fold for the model deleting that fold, and to
all of the cases again for the model deleting the current fold.
When the indices argument is missing, procedure() returns the cross-validation criterion for all of the cases based on
the model fit to all of the cases.}

\item{data}{full data frame}

\item{k}{perform k-fold cross-validation (default is n-fold)}

\item{seed}{for R's random number generator}

\item{parallel}{do computations in parallel? (default is FALSE)}

\item{ncores}{number of cores to use for parallel computations
(default is number of physical cores detected)}

\item{...}{arguments to be passed to `procedure()`.}

\item{indices}{indices of cases in data defining the current fold}

\item{model}{a regression model object fit to data}

\item{criterion}{a CV criterion function}

\item{k.}{the `k` argument to `stepAIC()` (note the period in `k.`).}
}
\value{
a "cv" object with the cv criterion averaged across the folds,
the bias-adjusted averaged cv criterion,
the criterion applied to the model fit to the full data set,
and the initial value of R's RNG seed
